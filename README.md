** Project: Button Control with Timer and PWM **
This project demonstrates the control of two buttons using a timer that operates at a refresh rate of 10 Hz. The buttons trigger interrupts that flash LEDs using Pulse Width Modulation (PWM). The LEDs are controlled by a timer using PWM and interrupts, with the timer set to a refresh rate of 150 Hz.
