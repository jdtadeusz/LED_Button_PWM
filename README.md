# Project: Button Control with Timer and PWM 
This project demonstrates the control of two buttons using a timer 6 that operates at a refresh rate of 10 Hz. The buttons trigger interrupts that flash LEDs using Pulse Width Modulation (PWM). The LEDs are controlled by a timer 3 using PWM, with the timer set to a refresh rate of 150 Hz.
